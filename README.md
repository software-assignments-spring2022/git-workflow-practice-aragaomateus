 ## *comments:*
It was last year when I first heard about the term web3. In an attempt to not miss the trendI researched everything I could to try to understand it. Listing to podcas, reading articles and starting to learn to code some smart contracts to see what it was about. 
As I the time went by I start to understand even less, which made me realize, why is there people talking about all the time. I realized that I was actaully listing to the people who have strong economic interest talk about their own prjects and projects without economic interest such as Ethereum foundation, have struggled to fix fundamental problems such high gas prices which hinders the capacity of eth to be more than an speculative asset. 
The article about offers a range of possibilities for who ever wants to learn what web and its associeted terms are all about. It is not very deep but you can find references to more elaborate works. 
My personal criticism is that i think this whole trends ends up attracting great minds to the work on the solutions for non existing problems for the sake of monetary report fueld by VCs.
